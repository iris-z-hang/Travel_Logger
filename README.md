# **Travel Logger**
### Iris Zhang

The goal of my project is to develop an application that helps travellers when they arrive at a new city. The user
will be able to input the name, address, and coordinates of a destination they want to visit. The application will 
then keep track of this list for the user. There will also be an option to input places already visited. At the end
of their trip, the application will tell the user how many kilometers they travelled in that city. The target for this
application is people that like to keep track of where they have gone and where they have left to go.

This project is interesting to me because from my previous university degree, I have a certificate in *Geographic 
Information Systems* (GIS). In my GIS classes, we created maps using applications such as ArcGIS Pro and ENVI. I spent a lot
of time inputting coordinates and locations in geodatabases. I think it would be useful and fun to develop an
application that has some functionality of GIS applications, but with a more casual, user-oriented purpose.
